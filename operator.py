# operator - specific symbols that helps us to perform operations on variables and values.
#Examples-  +, -, *, /, %, **, //, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
#Tpyes of operators: Arithmetic operator, Relational operators
#Formated string

# a = 8
# b = 4
# c = 2

# sum = a + b + c
# product = a * b
# dif = a - c
# div = a / b
# pow = a** c
# quotient = a // c  # 8 // 2 = 4
# mod = a % b  # 8 % 4 = 1


# print("Sum is:", sum)
# print("Product is:", product)
# print("Difference is:", dif)
# print("Division is:", div)
# print("Power is:", pow)
# print("Quotient is:", quotient)
# print("Remainder is:", mod)



# <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=

# a= 8
# b = 4
# c = 8

# print(a < b) # 8 < 4
# print(a > b) # 8 > 4
# print(a == c)
# print(a != c)
# print(a <= b) # 8 <= 4
# print(a >= b) # 8 >= 4
