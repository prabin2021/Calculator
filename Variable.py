# Variables are used for storing data values.
# Rules while creating variable's name:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
# 3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables
# 5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

#Examples:

# x = 5
# y = -2
# z = "Hello, World!"
# name = "Alice"
# age = 25 

# name1 = "Prabin"
# full_name  = "Prabin Sigdel"

# Age = 30
# print(age)


name = "Prabin"
age = 24
print("My name is ", name)
print("My age is ", age)
