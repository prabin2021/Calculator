Lists vs Tuples:

List: 
ordered, changeable, allows duplicate members., syntax [], methods are available, accessing the value is slow, data are not secured as compared to tuples

Tuple:
ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicate members. syntax (), methods are not available, accessing the value is fast, data are secured here than list

Set:
unordered, unchangeable, doesn't allow duplicate members, syntax {}, methods are not available,
